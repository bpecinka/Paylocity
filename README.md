API automation - test written in HTTP client in Aqua. In case you have question about running or anything else let me know
FE automation - test written in playwright. Having properly set-up playwright should suffice.

I removed token from env.json. It needs to be add for api test to work. Token was provided by Paylocity.

In case you encounter any issue or have any questins regarding the code please let me know.

Thanks.
